name= input("Tell me your name: ")
current_year=int(input("What is the current year? "))
age= int(input("How old are you? "))
year_born= int(current_year - age)
years_to_100=int(100-age)
year_will_be_100= int(current_year + years_to_100)

print("Your name is " + name + ". You're " + str(age) + " years old. And the current year is " + str(current_year) + ". So, in " + str(years_to_100) + " you'll be 100 years old. And the year will be " + str(year_will_be_100))
